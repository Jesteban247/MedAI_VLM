original|text|Medical Knowledge|What is a brain tumor?||"A brain tumor is a mass of abnormal cells that grows in the brain. These cells can be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). While the term ""brain tumor"" is often used to refer to cancerous tumors, it's important to remember that many brain tumors are not cancerous and are therefore not life-threatening.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **What it is:** An abnormal growth of cells in the brain.
*   **Where it grows:** Within the brain tissue itself or near the brain.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Benign:** Non-cancerous. They tend to grow slowly, stay localized, and are less likely to spread to other parts of the body. However, even benign tumors can cause problems by pressing on surrounding brain tissue, nerves, or blood vessels.
    *   **Malignant:** Cancerous. They grow rapidly, can spread to other parts of the brain"|843|10.4

*   **Benign:** Non-cancerous, slow-growing, and typically remain localized. However, they can still cause problems by pressing on nearby brain tissue and structures.
*   **Malignant:** Cancerous, characterized by rapid growth, invasion into surrounding tissues, and potential for metastasis (spreading to other parts of the brain or distant organs).
*   **Mixed:** Contain a combination of both benign and malignant tumor components."|516|5.94
